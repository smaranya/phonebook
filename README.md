Attached in this repo is the code for a phone book management system in C using the concept of linked lists.

This program allows you to -

> add phone numbers and other details to the phone book, 

> delete them and 

> update the details by accessing the contact through the "NAME" field as required.

> You can also search for a contact in the phone book by using the "NAME".

P.S. This was my mini project in the second year of engineering, so feel free to provide any suggestions that you have!
